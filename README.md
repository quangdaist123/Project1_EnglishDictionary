# A very simple English Dictionary
This is the first project in the Python Mega Course on Udemy. I didn't follow the original source code. Instead, I just read the project description and went on to DIY. Some parts of the code were referenced from other programmers on Google

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
## Usage

You just need to run tkinter_test.py
Here are the screenshot:
